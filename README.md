# Exploring Market Trends in the Used Bike Market Segment üö≤

## üìå Business Problem

The used bike market is one of the fastest-growing segments in the automobile industry, primarily due to rising fuel prices, affordability concerns, and a growing demand for sustainable commuting options. Despite this growth, the market is **highly fragmented**. Buyers often face challenges such as **price fluctuations, inconsistent vehicle condition, hidden defects, and a lack of transparency in service and ownership history**. These challenges not only create confusion for buyers but also make it difficult for sellers to establish trust and fair pricing.

By using **data-driven approaches**, it is possible to bring clarity into this fragmented market. This project aims to address these issues by analyzing real-world used bike listing data, uncovering patterns, and providing actionable insights for all stakeholders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This project followed a structured pipeline, starting with **data collection (web scraping)**, moving through **data cleaning and preprocessing**, and finally conducting a **detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

1. **Web Scraping**:

   * The data was extracted from [Bike4Sale](https://bike4sale.com), an online marketplace for used bikes.
   * Python libraries such as `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup` were used to fetch and parse HTML content.
   * Data points collected included **bike company, bike model, model year, price, finance availability (yes/no), city, and state**.
   * Pagination was handled to ensure data was gathered across multiple listing pages, and results were stored in structured **CSV format** for further analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**:

   * Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values.
   * Standardized formats for model years and prices.
   * Encoded categorical variables like finance availability into structured formats.
   * Ensured the dataset was consistent and reliable before moving to analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   * **Univariate Analysis** examined price ranges, yearly listing counts, and brand popularity.
   * **Bivariate Analysis** compared variables such as price vs. model year, city vs. average price, and brand vs. price range.
   * **Multivariate Analysis** combined multiple factors like location, finance availability, and year to understand overall market trends.
   * Visualizations were built using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to highlight patterns and insights.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis ‚Äì Key Insights

The analysis revealed several important findings about the used bike market:

### 1. Price Distribution

Most used bikes are priced below **‚Çπ200,000**, with the majority falling in the range of **‚Çπ50,000 to ‚Çπ150,000**, which indicates that the market is largely affordable to middle-income buyers. Premium or rare bikes such as **Kawasaki Z900** and **Triumph Trident 660** appear as outliers, often listed above ‚Çπ800,000, representing a smaller but notable luxury segment.

### 2. Brand Popularity

The analysis shows that **Royal Enfield dominates the used bike market**, accounting for nearly **19% of all listings**, followed by **Bajaj (17%)** and **TVS (14%)**. Yamaha, Honda, and Hero also have significant presence in the resale market. The dominance of Royal Enfield reflects strong brand loyalty and high resale value retention.

### 3. Regional Trends

Maharashtra emerged as the **state with the highest number of listings**, suggesting a strong second-hand bike culture in urban and semi-urban areas of the state. On the other hand, states like **Goa, Tripura, and Meghalaya** had the lowest listings, highlighting limited market activity there. Metro cities such as **Bangalore, Pune, and Chennai** showed much higher average resale prices, confirming that demand is stronger in urban centers.

### 4. Popular Models

Models such as **Royal Enfield Classic 350, Thunderbird 350, and Hunter 350 Metro** are consistently the most popular in the resale market. Other popular choices include **Yamaha R15 V4**, **TVS Apache RTR 160**, and **Ola S1 Pro** in the electric bike segment. These trends highlight a strong demand for mid-range commuter and premium bikes.

### 5. Time-Based Trends

The number of used bike listings increased steadily from **2005 to 2015**, followed by a sharp surge from **2017 onwards**. The year **2023 recorded the highest number of listings**, indicating peak activity. However, listings in **2024 and 2025 showed a decline**, which may be due to incomplete recent data or shifting market conditions. Additionally, average resale prices have **increased sharply since 2015**, reflecting higher demand, inflation, and growing interest in premium bikes.

### 6. Finance Availability

Bikes with **finance availability marked as ‚ÄúYes‚Äù** were generally priced higher, reflecting the fact that financing options make bikes more attractive to buyers, thereby raising their market value.
